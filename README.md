# Astrodynamics with Rust

A performant astrodynamics library, written in rust, with Python bindings.
The codes have been written with both accuracy and speed in mind.
Sensible interfaces and defaults are provided when possible.

# Features

* Time scale and coordinate transformations
* Numerical (SP), SGP4, and Keplerian orbit propagation
* Access to JPL planetary ephemerides
* Access to high-order gravity models
* High-precision numerical satellite orbit propagation

## ODE Solvers

The high-precision numerical satellite orbit propagation makes use of standard Runga-Kutta methods for integration of ordinary differential equations. 
The methods use Runga-Kutta pairs for ODE integration and error estimation that are generated by Jim Verner: [https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/](https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/)
