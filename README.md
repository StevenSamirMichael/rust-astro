# Satellite Toolkit with Rust

A high-performance satellite toolkit library, written in rust, with Python bindings.
The codes have been written with both accuracy and speed in mind.
Sensible interfaces and defaults are provided when possible.

# Features

- Timescale transformations (UTC, GPS, UT1, TBD, TT, ...)
- High-precision coordinate transforms between:
  - International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF)
  - Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF) using IAU-2000 reduction
  - True-Equinox Mean Equator (TEME) frame used in SGP4 propagation of TLEs
  - Celestial Intermediate Reference Frame (CIRF)
  - Terrestrial Intermediate Reference Frame (TIRF)
  - Terrestrial Geodetic frame (latitude, longitude)
- SGP4, and Keplerian orbit propagation
- JPL planetary ephemerides
- High-order gravity models
- High-precision, high-speed numerical satellite orbit propagation with high-order efficient Runga-Kutta solvers, ability to solve for state transition matrix, and inclusion following forces:
  - High-order Earth gravity with multiple models
  - Solar gravity
  - Lunar gravity
  - Drag (NRL MISE-00 density model)
  - Radiation pressure

## ODE Solvers

The high-precision numerical satellite orbit propagation makes use of standard Runga-Kutta methods for integration of ordinary differential equations. The ODE solver is included as part of the library.

The methods use Runga-Kutta pairs for ODE integration and error estimation generated by Jim Verner: [https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/](https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/)
